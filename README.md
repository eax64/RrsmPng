# rrsmpng
Really Really Show My Png. A tool that try to (really) show you a png.
This is a development version, not usable yet.

A regular png viewer won't be able to display a png with a corrupt header, or corrupted data.

This is what this tool try to do by ignoring the creating its own header depending on what available information could be retrieved.
